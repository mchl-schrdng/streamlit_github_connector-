## ðŸ”¥ Note

Certain functionalities, such as fetching historical data, might require a specific subscription plan on CoinMarketCap. If you encounter the following exception:

```
Exception: Error fetching data:
{
    "status": {
        "timestamp": "2023-07-27T20:27:50.369Z",
        "error_code": 1006,
        "error_message": "Your API Key subscription plan doesn't support this endpoint.",
        "elapsed": 0,
        "credit_count": 0
    }
}
```

It indicates that your current API subscription plan doesn't support the endpoint you're trying to access. Consider upgrading or modifying your plan on CoinMarketCap to access those specific features.
